# Rust Learning
Teaching myself rust by building small projects. 

Starting off building a bunch of casino games. They are well defined games, where you can continually add more functionality to them, and they are very easy to test. They are quite easy to get un-stuck too, since chat-gpt or claude can easily understand what you are building.

It would actually be a great idea to use this exact concept to learn any new language. If I want to learn Clojure after Rust, then I already have all the Rust examples, and I can use it as a reference

## TODO
- [x] Finish Roulette plays
- [x] Refactor
- [ ] Handle errors to ask again for input
- [ ] Add in betting
- [ ] Do tests for each game

Then add more functionality to blackjack, add a new game, or do something else.
