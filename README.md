# Rust Learning
Teaching myself rust by building small projects. 

Starting off building a bunch of casino games. They are well defined games, where you can continually add more functionality to them, and they are very easy to test. They are quite easy to get un-stuck too, since chat-gpt or claude can easily understand what you are building.

It would actually be a great idea to use this exact concept to learn any new language. If I want to learn Clojure after Rust, then I already have all the Rust examples, and I can use it as a reference

## Future work
- Do tests for each game (Randomness and user input make this a bit harder, so it would mean adjusting the code to handle inputs that are not random)
- Make a single entry point for all games (i.e. a casino.rs that allows you to play all the games)
